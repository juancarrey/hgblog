This is the sotry of the release to production for the first time of
[enremoto.co]( https://enremoto.co "full remote jobs at enremoto.co").

## Prelude

It's a period of operational party, a new release is upcoming, the nerves arises from the nothing, the ambient is calm and frightening.
A brave software engineer of underground freedom programmers has challenged the server to uphold a new awesome containerized instance.

## Ready
The compose file looks ready 👌, the domain has been obtained successfully, everything looks good. 🤞🤞

The theater opens the curtains and the stage is revealed, another success on releasing to production rightfully done, yet something is off, there is literally no one looking 😨.

The remote engineer looks at Google, and ask him to look at the stage, he won't. What's going on? Leave it, it sure takes it's time.

## Go
A little bit of promotion should get the ball rolling, and then suddenly, the evil forces strike the young dev, he realises that the domain is suspicious of MALWARE 🦠 they say.. But HOW? It's brand new!? Exactly.

That great domain was in a spam list ☣, so that everyone would think of it as dangerous, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google and so on, the ball did not start rolling and for a good reason.

The young lad lose his first encounter, but he kept going 💪, got the domain to a safe spot and left the waters calm, so he could go to bed at least.

## Lessons learned

Verify the health of any purchasing domain before promoting it, removing it from the blacklist was about one day (quite awesomic reply from [Spamhouse](https://www.spamhaus.org/))

Hopefully it was a nice read ❤❤
